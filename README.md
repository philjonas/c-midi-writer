# c-midi-writer

This is a side project where I have the opportunity to learn more about how MIDI files are put together.

The objective is to write a tiny C library that will allow me to generate simple MIDI files.

## TO DO:
* automate repetitive parts
* on running the program save each scale as a separate MIDI file
* all notes spaced apart equally
* handle edge case "Melodic minor scale"
