<h4>The official MIDI Spec is tricky and hard to read. I have distilled it here 
for your reading pleasure. -- David Van Brink</h4>
<hr>

<center>
<h2>The MIDI Specification</h2></center>
<p><b>Serial Protocol</b><br>31250 (± 1%) baud asynchronous, with 1 start bit, 8 
data bits, and one stop bit. Thus, each data byte takes 10 serial bits, and is 
sent in 320 microseconds. The connection is a 1.5 mA current loop, and the 
receiver is opto-isolated, and requires less than 5mA to turn on. Logical 0 is 
current "on." Rise and fall times must be less than 2 microseconds. 
</p><p><b>The MIDI Bus</b><br>The MIDI bus is designed to address 16 channels. More 
than this would seriously tax the bandwidth of the bus at 31.25 kbaud. Each 
device on the bus may receive on one or more channels. Sometimes, multiple 
devices may receive on the same channel, with various desired or undesired 
side-effects. The channels are numbered 1 to 16, and, at the low command level, 
are addressed as 0 to 15. 
</p><p>The MIDI bus operates in a one-way fashion; generally a computer and MIDI 
setup looks like this. 
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./davids_midi_spec_files/DMSfig1.gif" border="2"></center>
<p>Each wire is one-way. The computer, therefore, receives no information from 
the two sound modules. 
</p><p><b>Message Formats</b><br>Messages consist of a byte stream. Bytes with the 
high-bit set establish some kind of mode and are called "status bytes." Bytes 
with the high-bit clear are data bytes within the most recently established 
mode. Using the same status byte for multiple data messages is referred to as 
"running status." Some status bytes are directed to a particular channel. In the 
chart below, the letter 'c' is used to represent a channel nibble in a status 
byte. 
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./davids_midi_spec_files/DMStable1.gif" border="2"></center>
<p><b><i>Note On, Note Off</i></b><br>The pitch is in the range 0 to 127, where 
Middle C is pitch number 60. Values outside the range of the instrument, or the 
particular sound, are octave-shifted into range. The "velocity" is how quickly, 
or hard, the key was struck. A velocity of zero in a note-on event is a note-off 
event. A velocity of 64 is "average," and a keyboard that cannot sense velocity 
should report a velocity of 64 for each keypress. 
</p><p><b><i>Key Pressure, Channel Pressure</i></b><br>Some keyboards can detect a 
change in pressure on each key, while they are held by the player; these 
keyboards can report "key pressure" over MIDI. Some keyboards may sense the 
overall pressure on the device, such as with a weight sensor beneath the entire 
keyboard. These devices can report "channel pressure." 
</p><p><b><i>Controller Change</i></b><br>Various sliders, buttons, and knobs on 
MIDI keyboards are referred to as "controllers." On sound modules, some of the 
attributes which can be changed in real-time are called "controllers." 
Controllers are numbered from 0 to 121, and some of them have defined purposes. 
The values 122-127 are reserved in the controller-change message for special 
mode messages. 
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./davids_midi_spec_files/DMStable2.gif" border="2"></center>
<p>Note that "MSB" and "LSB" refer to 7-bit values. 
</p><p><b><i>Program Change</i></b><br>A sound module may switch easily between as 
many as 128 different programmed sounds, numbered 0 to 127. 
</p><p>Many synthesizers support more than 128 programmed sounds by means of a "bank 
select" command. Older synths have typically used a device-specific system 
exclusive (see below) command. Newer synths use controllers 0 and 32 to select a 
bank. Unfortunately, there is no standard for whether it is, in fact, controller 
0 or 32, or both, and if both, must be sent first. 
</p><p><b><i>Pitch Bend</i></b><br>The pitch bend wheel is also a continuous 
controller on many MIDI keyboards. Possibly, the Pitch Bend message is in its 
own category because it is something likely to be done frequently. The two bytes 
of the pitch bend message form a 14 bit number, 0 to 16383. The value 8192 
(sent, LSB first, as 0x00 0x40), is centered, or "no pitch bend." The value 0 
(0x00 0x00) means, "bend as low as possible," and, similarly, 16383 (0x7F 0x7F) 
is to "bend as high as possible." The exact range of the pitch bend is specific 
to the synthesizer. 
</p><p><b><i>System Exclusive, End of SysEx</i></b><br>A System Exclusive message, 
or "SysEx," is a message that is vendor, or synthesizer, specific. The first one 
or three data bytes of the sysex specifies the vendor. (Originally, it was only 
one byte, but now the value "0" is used as an escapement to reach the next two.) 
The sysex type message may legally occur at any time, including in the middle of 
other kinds of messages. 
</p><p>A sysex message may look like this: 0xF0 vendorID data ... 0xF7. Many vendors 
have their own format for what follows the vendor ID, specifying synthesizer 
number, or message length, and so on. 
</p><p><b><i>Song Position, Song Select</i></b><br>The Song Position message tells 
all MIDI sequencers on the MIDI bus where to start playing when a Start Song 
message is received. This time is specified in "Timing Ticks." The Song Select 
message specifies which song number to play at that time. 
</p><p><b><i>Unofficial Bus Select</i></b><br>Some vendors have produced boxes with 
a single MIDI input, and multiple MIDI outputs. The Bus Select message specifies 
which of the outputs further data should be sent to. This is not an official 
message; the vendors in question should have used a SysEx command. 
</p><p><b><i>Tune Request</i></b><br>Possibly obsolete in the age of digital 
synthesizers... supposed to tell the synthesizer to retune its oscillators. 
</p><p><b><i>Timing Tick</i></b><br>Tells all sequencers on the MIDI bus to advance 
by a single "tick." 
</p><p><b><i>Start Song, Continue Song, Stop Song</i></b><br>Tells all sequencers on 
the MIDI bus to start, continue, or stop playing. 
</p><p><b><i>Active Sensing</i></b><br>If a MIDI device receives an Active Sensing 
message, then it should enter "active sensing mode." In that mode, if no 
messages are received for 300 milliseconds, then it should silence all sound 
output. The Active Sensing byte itself is a valid message to inhibit this 
silencing. This helps make sure that a "hung" MIDI system automatically silences 
itself. 
</p><p><b><i>System Reset</i></b><br>This message commands a device to return to its 
initial, powerup state.

<h2>Examples</h2></center>
<p><b>A Simple MIDI Stream</b><br>The following hexadecimal bytes are a simple, 
typical stream of MIDI data. Each message must be sent at the real-time that the 
synthesizer is supposed to perform the action. Sophisticated sequencers will 
send the message slightly ahead of time to account for the duration of the 
message -- one third of a millisecond per byte -- and the response time of the 
particular synthesizer -- perhaps several milliseconds. The perceptual 
improvement of accuracy under 5 or 10 milliseconds, to the untrained listener, 
is questionable. 
</p><p><b><i>90 3C 40 </i></b><br>Play middle C (note number 60, hexadecimal 3C) on 
channel 1 (the zero nibble of 90), at half the full velocity (velocity 64, 
hexadecimal 40). 
</p><p><b><i>43 40 </i></b><br>Play note G above middle C (note number 67, 
hexadecimal 43) at velocity 64. Note that the status byte of 90 from the first 
message is still in effect, and did not have to be resent. 
</p><p><b><i>B9 07 33 </i></b><br>Change the volume of MIDI channel 10 to 51 
(hexadecimal 33). The MIDI volume controller number is 7. 
</p><p><b><i>B3 07 10 </i></b><br>Change the volume of MIDI channel 4 to 16 
(hexadecimal 10). Since the channel number is different than the previous 
message, running status could not be used. 
</p><p><b><i>90 3C 00 </i></b><br>Stop playing middle C on channel 1. The last byte 
of zero indicates a "key down velocity of 0" which indicates a "note-off" event. 

</p><p><b><i>80 43 64 </i></b><br>Stop playing the G above middle C (key number 67, 
hexadecimal 43). The key is released with a velocity of 64. Since very few, if 
any, synthesizers implement an interpretation of the note-off volume, this 
message is generally equivalent to 90 43 00.
