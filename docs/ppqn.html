The MIDI file format's <a href="http://midi.teragonaudio.com/tech/midifile/tempo.htm">Tempo Meta-Event</a> expresses tempo as "the amount of time
(ie, microseconds) per quarter note". For example, if a Tempo Meta-Event contains the 3 bytes of 07 A1 20,
then each quarter note should be 0x07A120 (or 500,000) microseconds long.

<p>Normally, musicians express tempo as "the amount of quarter notes in every minute (ie, time period)". This is the opposite
of the way that the MIDI file format expresses it.

</p><p>When musicians refer to a "beat" in terms of tempo, they are referring to a quarter note (ie, a quarter note is always 1
beat when talking about tempo, regardless of the time signature. Yes, it's a bit confusing to non-musicians that the
time signature's "beat" may not be the same thing as the tempo's "beat" -- it won't be unless the time signature's beat also
happens to be a quarter note. But that's the traditional definition of BPM tempo). To a musician, tempo is therefore always
"how many quarter notes happen during every minute". Musicians refer to this measurement as BPM (ie, Beats Per Minute). So a
tempo of 100 BPM means that a musician must be able to play 100 steady quarter notes, one right after the other, in one
minute. That's how "fast" the "musical tempo" is at 100 BPM. It's very important that you understand the concept of how a
musician expresses "musical tempo" (ie, BPM) in order to properly present tempo settings to a musician, and yet be able to
relate it to how the MIDI file format expresses tempo.

</p><p>To convert the Tempo Meta-Event's tempo (ie, the 3 bytes that specify the amount of microseconds per quarter note) to
BPM:

</p><p>BPM = 60,000,000/(tt tt tt)

</p><p>For example, a tempo of 120 BPM = 07 A1 20 microseconds per quarter note.

</p><p>So why does the MIDI file format use "time per quarter note" instead of "quarter notes per time" to specify its tempo?
Well, its easier to specify more precise tempos with the former. With BPM, sometimes you have to deal with fractional tempos
(for example, 100.3 BPM) if you want to allow a finer resolution to the tempo. Using microseconds to express tempo offers
plenty of resolution.

</p><p>Also, SMPTE is a time-based protocol (ie, it's based upon seconds, minutes, and hours, rather than a musical tempo).
Therefore it's easier to relate the MIDI file's tempo to SMPTE timing if you express it as microseconds. Many musical
devices now use SMPTE to sync their playback.

<p>A sequencer typically uses some internal hardware timer counting off steady time (ie, microseconds perhaps) to generate a
software "PPQN clock" that counts off the timebase (Division) "ticks". In this way, the time upon which an event occurs can
be expressed to the musician in terms of a musical bar:beat:PPQN-tick rather than how many microseconds from the start of the
playback. Remember that musicians always think in terms of a beat, not the passage of seconds, minutes, etc.

</p><p>As mentioned, the microsecond tempo value tells you how long each one of your sequencer's "quarter notes" should be. From
here, you can figure out how long each one of your sequencer's PPQN clocks should be by dividing that microsecond value by
your MIDI file's <a href="http://midi.teragonaudio.com/tech/midifile/mthd.htm">Division</a>. For example, if your MIDI file's Division is 96 PPQN, then that means that each of your
sequencer's PPQN clock ticks at the above tempo should be 500,000 / 96 (or 5,208.3) microseconds long (ie, there should be
5,208.3 microseconds inbetween each PPQN clock tick in order to yield a tempo of 120 BPM at 96 PPQN. And there should
always be 96 of these clock ticks in each quarter note, 48 ticks in each eighth note, 24 ticks in each sixteenth, etc).

</p><p>Note that you can have any timebase at any tempo. For example, you can have a 96 PPQN file playing at
100 BPM just as you can have a 192 PPQN file playing at 100 BPM. You can also have a 96 PPQN file playing at either 100
BPM or 120 BPM. Timebase and tempo are two entirely separate quantities. Of course, they both are needed when you setup your
hardware timer (ie, when you set how many microseconds are in each PPQN tick). And of course, at slower tempos, your
PPQN clock tick is going to be longer than at faster tempos.

</p><hr size="5" noshade=""><p></p><center><font color="RED"><b>MIDI Clock</b></font></center>

<p>MIDI clock bytes are sent over MIDI, in order to sync the playback of 2 devices (ie, one device is generating MIDI clocks at
its current tempo which it internally counts off, and the other device is syncing its playback to the receipt of these
bytes). Unlike with SMPTE frames, MIDI clock bytes are sent at a rate related to the musical tempo.

</p><p>Since there are 24 MIDI Clocks in every quarter note, the length of a MIDI Clock (ie, time inbetween each MIDI
Clock message) is the microsecond tempo divided by 24. In the above example, that would be 500,000/24, or 20,833.3
microseconds in every MIDI Clock. Alternately, you can relate this to your timebase (ie, PPQN clock). If you have 96 PPQN,
then that means that a MIDI Clock byte must occur every 96 / 24 (ie, 4) PPQN clocks.

</p><hr size="5" noshade=""><p></p><center><font color="RED"><b>SMPTE</b></font></center>

<p>SMPTE counts off the passage of time in terms of seconds, minutes, and hours (ie, the way that non-musicians count time).
It also breaks down the seconds into smaller units called "frames". The movie industry created SMPTE, and they adopted 4
different frame rates. You can divide a second into 24, 25, 29, or 30 frames. Later on, even finer resolution was needed by
musical devices, and so each frame was broken down into "subframes".

</p><p>So, SMPTE is not directly related to musical tempo. SMPTE time doesn't vary with "musical tempo".

</p><p>Many devices use SMPTE to sync their playback. If you need to sychronize with such a device, then you may need to deal
with SMPTE timing. Of course, you're probably still going to have to maintain some sort of PPQN clock, based upon the
passing SMPTE subframes, so that the user can adjust the tempo of the playback in terms of BPM, and can consider the time
of each event in terms of bar:beat:tick. But since SMPTE doesn't directly relate to musical tempo, you have to interpolate
(ie, calculate) your PPQN clocks from the passing of subframes/frames/seconds/minutes/hours (just as we previously
calculated the PPQN clock from a hardware timer counting off microseconds).

</p><p>Let's take the easy example of 25 Frames and 40 SubFrames. As previously mentioned in the discussion of Division, this
is analogous to millisecond based timing because you have 1,000 SMPTE subframes per second. (You have 25 frames per
second. Each second is divided up into 40 subframes, and you therefore have 25 * 40 subframes per second. And remember that
1,000 milliseconds are also in every second). Every millisecond therefore means that another subframe has passed (and vice
versa). Every time you count off 40 subframes, a SMPTE frame has passed (and vice versa). Etc.

</p><p>Let's assume you desire 96 PPQN and a tempo of 500,000 microseconds. Considering that with 25-40
Frame-SubFrame SMPTE timing 1 millisecond = 1 subframe (and remember that 1 millisecond = 1,000 microseconds), there
should be 500,000 / 1,000 (ie, 500) subframes per quarter note. Since you have 96 PPQN in every quarter note, then every
PPQN ends up being 500 / 96 subframes long, or 5.2083 milliseconds (ie, there's how we end up with that 5,208.3 microseconds
PPQN clock tick just as we did above in discussing PPQN clock). And since 1 millisecond = 1 subframe, every PPQN clock
tick also equals 5.2083 subframes at the above tempo and timebase.
